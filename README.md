# Firebaseic

This is a train scheduler assignment created using Firebase to take in user inputs, store the values, and output them onto a schedule. 
In this application, a user can input a train name, the destination, and the frequency the train arrives. When
the user clicks submit, the train is added to the schedule, and the next arrival time and and minutes remaining until the train arrives
is calculated and displayed .
